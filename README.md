## Installation
Simply add GHConsole folder with files to your project, or use CocoaPods.

#### CocoaPods
You can use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) to install `GHConsole` by adding it to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '7.0'
use_frameworks!
#you need to update your CocoaPods version if you can't find this pod.
target 'your_project_name' do
	pod 'GHConsole'
end
```

## Usage example

Simply start GHConsole in your App. GHConsole view will be added above the key window as a view.

You can find example projects [here](https://github.com/liaoworking/GHConsole)

#### Start Log on GHConsole

You just only initialize GHConsole in your appDelegate.m When your App are launching.
**Objective-C usage**

```Objective-C
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
   [[GHConsole sharedConsole]startPrintLog];
    return YES;
}
```

**Swift usage**

```Swift
 func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        GHConsole.sharedConsole.startPrintLog()
        return true
    }
```

And then, you can use GGLog( ) like NSLog( )

**Objective-C usage**

```Objective-C
GGLog(@"This is some log I just want to show in GHConsole")；



  NSDictionary *parameterDict = @{@"paraKey1":@"paraValue1",
                                    @"paraKey2":@"paraValue2",
                                    @"paraKey3":@"paraValue2"
                                    }
GGLog(@"%@",parametersDict);

//if you  want to see the responsJSon from the API, you can just use GGLog( ) like NSLog( ) here.
GGLog(@"%@",responsJSON);
```

**Swift usage**

```Swift
GGLog("This is a log I just want to show in GHConsole")
        
let parameterDict = ["paraKey1":"paraValue1","paraKey2":"paraValue2","paraKey3":"paraValue3"] as [String:Any]
GGLog("\(parameterDict)")
        
//if you  want to see the responsJSon from the API, you can just use GGLog( ) like NSLog( ) here.
GGLog("if you  want to see the responsJSon from the API, you can just use GGLog( ) like NSLog( ) here!")
```


When you double tap  The GHConsole in your app and then the appearance of it just like this.

#### Stop Logging

Call when you're done with GHConsole.

**Objective-C usage**

```Objective-C
[GHConsole shareConsole]stop];
```
**Swift usage**

```Swift
GHConsole.sharedConsole.stopPrinting()
```
if you don't want to see the GHConsole,you just need to annotate it.

```Objective-C
//[[GHConsole sharedConsole]startPrintLog];
```

## Performance


GHConsole is based on `printf` in C. Better performance to NSLog.



The time consuming of printing a string for 10000 times
